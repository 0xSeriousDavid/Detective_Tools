When I grow up, I will definitely become a hacker in a white hat. For now, I just need to grow up and study general education subjects well, especially computer science and mathematics. After that, I will definitely enroll in a university or at least a college, where I will study programming in depth, gradually moving towards my goal.

But since I am still very far from my goal, I will try to become a detective. This does not require programming knowledge. It is important for a detective to be able to use special tools that help him track down criminals.

Probably for any detective, as well as for a criminal, it is very important to maintain confidentiality in order to ensure their safety. Therefore, every detective must carefully use a fictitious name and under no circumstances reveal their real name to anyone. Likewise, a detective should always use a VPN or proxy, preferably operating from a fake location.

In this repository, I will post a list of tools that are very important for detectives and help them in their investigations. As I find new tools, I will expand this list.
